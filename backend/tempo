code is a **Node.js** backend application built using the **Express.js** framework. It serves as a chatbot system with file upload support, user authentication, CSV file parsing, and chart generation using Highcharts-like configuration.

---

### 🔧 **Modules Used**

* `express`: Web framework to handle HTTP routes.
* `cors`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* `multer`: Handles file uploads.
* `path`, `fs`: File path resolution and file system operations.
* `sqlite3`: Lightweight SQL database used to persist users and conversations.
* `axios`: Makes HTTP requests (used to call the OpenAI API).
* `csv-parser`: Parses CSV files.
* `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

---

### 🌐 **Server Setup**

```js
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
```

Starts an Express server on the specified port (default 5000).

---

### 🔐 **Environment Configuration**

```js
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

Reads your OpenAI API key from `.env`.

---

### 📂 **Middleware**

* `cors()` and `express.json()` handle CORS and JSON payloads.
* Static serving of uploaded files: `/uploads`.

---

### 📁 **Uploads Directory**

If it doesn’t exist, the `uploads/` folder is created to store files.

---

### 📤 **File Upload with Multer**

Configured to:

* Save files to `uploads/` with unique names.
* Restrict file types (e.g. images, CSVs, PDFs, Word/Excel files).
* Limit size to 10MB.

---

### 🗄️ **SQLite Database Tables**

Two tables:

1. `users`: Stores `username` and `password`.
2. `conversations`: Stores user messages, AI responses, file info, and optional chart data.

---

### 📊 **CSV Chart Parsing**

If a CSV is uploaded:

* Parsed with `csv-parser`.
* Headers are detected.
* Numeric and category columns are identified.
* A **Highcharts-compatible config** is generated with a smart chart type (`column`, `line`).

---

### 📌 **Main Features**

#### 🔐 Signup (`POST /signup`)

Creates a new user.

#### 🔐 Login (`POST /login`)

Authenticates a user by checking their username and password.

#### 💬 Chat with File Upload (`POST /chat`)

* Accepts user message + optional file (CSV, image, etc.).
* If CSV:

  * Parses it.
  * Generates a chart configuration.
* Sends the message to **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini**.
* Stores conversation, file info, and chart data in the database.
* Returns the AI reply, chart config, and file info.

#### 📜 Get Conversations (`GET /conversations/:userId`)

Returns a user's full chat history including file references and chart data.

#### ❌ Delete a Conversation (`DELETE /conversations/:id`)

Removes a chat by its ID.

---

### 📈 **Chart Generation Logic**

* First 20 rows are used.
* If there's one numeric column and many rows → `line` chart.
* If >2 numeric columns → `line`.
* Else → default to `column`.

---

### ❗ Error Handling

* For file upload issues (Multer).
* For API and DB errors (OpenAI or SQLite).

---

### ▶️ **Server Start**

```js
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`✅ Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

This app:

* Allows users to sign up and log in.
* Lets users chat with GPT-4o-mini.
* Supports file uploads (CSV, images, docs).
* Automatically generates data visualizations from CSVs.
* Saves everything in a local SQLite database.
